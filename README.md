## Todo App

A general `CRUD` Todo App powered with `GraphQL` on server side, `Apollo` + `React` on client side and designed using `Ant Design` components.

## Getting started

Install all the dependencies for a root directory (client) and server/ directory. Consider installing `react-app-rewired` to run the app, it is used to make import of `Ant Design` components easier.
